The Apple Tree had a boring life before the boy moved into the cabin hidden behind the hill.  She liked the animals that lived in her branches, but this boy loves her.  He would always be amazed over her apples, and carefully climb as high as he could in her branches.  Every summer he would come to the cabin, and the tree would look forward to his visits.

Then he grew older.  Once he came with a friend.  After a time spent clambering through the tree, his friend pulled out a sharp metal object, cutting at one of the trees smaller branches.  The tree was shocked at the pain that came from the tiny knife, but her boy did not stop his friend.  Instead he took the cutted branch in his hand, and once his friend cut away another branch, skipped back an forth, bashing the wood against each other.  Soon they grew bored, and tossed aside the tree’s branches, walking away together.

Then Later he came with a girl and a different metal object.  They stayed at the base of the tree, whispering together and the tree felt love for him.  Then he took out his own knife, and carved his and the girl's initials into the trees bark.

Time went by, the boy grew older and the tree was often alone. Then, he came to the tree asking if the tree can give him money. The tree told him to gather the apples and sell them in the city. He did and the tree was happy.

After a long time, the boy came back to the tree. The boy asks if the tree could give him a house. The tree offered her branches, where the boy used to climb when he was little. The boy cut off her branches and carried them away to build his house. The tree was happy.

He did not come for many years, and when he did it was with an axe. The sad boy wanted a boat that will take him to far places. The tree gave her trunk to the boy for him to sail away and be happy. He cut her down and the tree was happy, but not really.

The boy came back again to the tree that is now an old stump. The tree apologized as she had none to offer the boy for his happiness. Tired, the boy simply wants a quiet place to sit and rest. The tree gathered her remaining strength and offered the boy a sit. The boy did and the tree was happy.
