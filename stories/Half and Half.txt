Teacher Ligaya was everyone's favorite teacher at the Umingan Elementary School.
She was seldom sad. 
And she was never mad. 
True to her name, she was always happy. 
She smiled easily and laughed heartily. 

She also hummed merrily, "LA-LA-RIN-LA-RIN!"
</page>

Her art class was just over, and she was now going to choose the best work for the Inter-school Kalikasan Art Contest next week. 
She put the pile of drawing papers on her table, took off her shoes, sat on one of her feet, sat on her chair and put on her glasses. 
"LA-LA-RIN-LA-RIN!"
</page>
<page img='IMG00003'>
On the blackboard behind her were written: Draw your Five Favorite Fruits.

"Well done!" she said as she looked at one paper. 
Drawn on it was a kasuy, a santol, a bunch of duhat, a sampalok and aratiles. 
"Excellent!" she said next and smiled. 
"Nice shapes!" she blurted out. 
"Wow!" she exclaimed one after the other, smiling from ear to ear. 
She was very proud of her pupils' work.

They are all very good... she thought.

Up until she got to the last paper.
</page>
<page img='IMG00004'>
"What's this?!?" she said, shocked. 
Her glasses slid down to the tip of her long nose. "This can't be!" she cried.

And when she read the name written on the back of the paper, she was even more shocked: Mateo Ador Dacanay, Jr. 
"Oh, Teo, how could you!?" she sighed. Her smile shrunk.
</page>
<page img='IMG00005'>
Teo was her best student. 
He always topped his classes in all subjects.
In fact, Teacher Ligaya was expecting Teo to hand in the best work, as always, in art.

Although he was half-orphaned and was poor, Teo was a well-behaved, well-adjusted boy. 
He lived alone with his father, a hard-working farm kapatas who was a kind, friendly man. 
Teo often talked about how he and his father enjoyed doing so many things together. 
In all of grade two, Teo was by far the most creative, most artistic, most cooperative, most active, most cheerful, most... everything! 
He was the best athlete, too.
</page>
<page img='IMG00006'>
But now, this! 
Teacher Ligaya could not believe how Teo could have misunderstood, or worse, disobeyed her instructions: Draw your Five Favorite Fruits. 
"Something must have happened to that boy!" Teacher Ligaya muttered over and over. 
Teo had always been smart and obedient.

Teacher Ligaya's smiled turned completely into a frown. 
For the first time, her face looked sad and worried.
</page>
<page img='IMG00007'>
She looked closely at Teo's paper again. 
Painted on it, in a combination of watercolor, colored pencils and crayons, were - half a macopa... half a guava... half a buko... half a banana... and half a caimito. 
There were five fruits, all right, drawn beautifully and painted with bright, happy colors, but there were only one-half of each fruit!
</page>
<page img='IMG00008'>
Teacher Ligaya stood up quickly. 
She wanted to talk to Teo immediately and find out what was wrong with him. 
In her rush, she bumped into the principal, Mr. De Guzman, in the corridor.

"Ah, Teacher Ligaya!" Mr. De Guzman greeted her. 
"I see you have chosen already the best art work in your class!" he said, looking at Teo's paper in her hands.

"Uh, ah," Teacher Ligaya began to explain.
</page>
<page>
"Let me see that -" the bulky, roundish principal said, taking the piece of paper from her. 
"Oh, what a lovely painting! They look almost like real fruits!"

"Well, that's not -" Teacher Ligaya tried to interrupt.

"Hmmm... they look so delicious, too. If I didn't know you taught grade 2, I'd say this was done by an adult artist! 
Why, whoever drew these is very talented, very gifted indeed!" he continued, his face flushed with excitement.
</page>
<page>
"Sir, uh, you see -" she tried to find the right words.

"And how creative you always are, Teacher Ligaya," he said, patting her on the back, "You made the children draw fruits in half! Ho, ho, ho! Brilliant idea, brilliant indeed! I think our school has a chance of winning the grand prize this year!" 
He returned the paper to Teacher Ligaya and strolled away.

Teacher Ligaya's open mouth froze in mid-air and she stared into space.
She knew she should have explained about the painting to Mr. De Guzman.
</page>

She took double steps to the basketball court where Teo usually player with the bigger boys from higher grades. 
"MATEO!!!" she called out, her voice echoing in the gym.

Teo instantly stopped playing and excused himself from everyone.

"Yes, Ma'am, what can I do for you?" he asked very politely, smiling at Teacher Ligaya.

"Follow me to the classroom quickly," she said, not smiling back. "I want to know something very important."

"Yes, Ma'am," Teo said, surprised why Teacher Ligaya was frowning. 
He'd never seen her frown before.
</page>
<page>
Teacher Ligaya sat on her desk and ask, "What's the matter with you Teo? Is there anything wrong?"

"Wrong?! Nothing's wrong, Ma'am." Teo said, shaking his head strongly.

"You know that all the schools in the whole town are preparing for the Inter-School Kalikasan Art Exhibit next week, don't you?" she asked again, this time she talked so fast she didn't stop for air.

"Yes, Teacher Ligaya," Teo answered instantly.

"So what did I ask you to do in art class today?"
</page>
<page>
"Teo was not used to seeing Teacher Ligaya without a smile. 
He suddenly felt nervous. "Er, draw my five favorite fruits, Ma'am," he said carefully.

"Right!" Teacher Ligaya said in a squeaky voice. "So what did you do?"
</page>
<page>
Teo was getting more afraid. "Ah, ah..."

Teacher Ligaya noticed that Teo was getting spooked by her voice. 
Always a thoughtful person, she put back on a smile, although not a very big one. 
And she made her voice a bit softer. "Come on, Mateo," she said gently, adjusting her eyeglasses on her nose. 
"I want an explanation. You know you can tell me the truth."
</page>
<page>
"Truth, Ma'am??!!" Teo was puzzled.

"Truth why you were the only one who did not follow my instruction. Look, I even wrote it on the board in big, big letters."

"But I did, Ma'am. I drew my five favorite -"

"No, what you did was draw HALF of your five favorite fruits," Teacher Ligaya interrupted Teo. 
"Now, slowly, explain to me why."
</page>
<page>
"Er, uh, Teacher... my father said, we don't really have much money. But sometimes, when he earns a little extra, he buys me a fruit," he said proudly. "I always cut the fruit in half..."

"Gulp!" Teacher Ligaya almost swallowed her tonsils.

"... one half for me, one half for my father."

"Gulp!" Teacher Ligaya's cheeks turns as red as the macopa in Teo's painting.

"I share whatever I have with my father because he always shared what he has with me!" he exclaimed.
</page>
<page>
"Gulp!" Teacher Ligaya's eyes turned as green as the guava in Teo's painting.

"My father always comes home very tired from the farm, so he deserves half of his pasalubong."

"Gulp!" Teacher Ligaya's lips turns as white as the buko in Teo's painting.

"That's the reason why - why my favorite fruits are only one-half," he said, his eyes twinkling.

"Gulp!" Teacher Ligaya's nose turned as yellow as the banana in Teo's painting.
</page>
<page>
Then Teo's happy face became serious, and he said slowly, "Sometimes I wish that my mother were still alive. I won't mind having only one-third of my fruit..."
</page>
<page>
Teacher Ligaya covered her hands which turned as purple as the caimito in Teo's painting. "Oh, my!" she cried.

Teo was surprised why his teacher was turning into so many colors. 
"Are you ok, Teacher Ligaya? Are you sick?"

No I am not okay! Yes, I am sick with shame! she said to herself. 
She was too embarrassed to even breathe.
</page>
<page>
"Are you mad at me, Ma'am?"

"Oh, Teo, never!' Teacher Ligaya said in a croaking voice.
I am mad at myself... she said in her mind. 
"I did not know... I thought... I am sorry for saying you did not follow my instruction, Teo." 
And slowly, the color of her skin was normal again. She smiled at Teo, the way she used to.

Teo smiled back. He liked Teacher Ligaya better when she smiled.
</page>
<page>
The cheerful teacher stood up to read aloud what was written on the board: "Draw your Five Favorite Fruits. Yes, you did exactly that, Teo."
She realized that the little boy did not disobey or misunderstand her instructions. 
It was she who misunderstood him.

"May I go play basketball now, Teacher Ligaya?"
</page>
<page>
At the Kalikasan Art Exhibit held at the Town Hall the following week, all the school children from all the schools, together with their teachers, turned up to watch the art show. 

"Super!"

"Ohhhhhh!"

"G'ling"

Everyone thought every single art work was really great. 
</page>
<page>
But the best of them all was flashed on a huge screen at the center of the place. 
It was a most extraordinary work of art. 
Beside the screen is a big poster on which was written:

"My Five Favorite Fruits" (Watercolor, pencil and crayon) by Mateo Ador Dacanay, Jr., Grade 2, Umingan Elementary School. 
This grand prize winner was the top choice of all judges. 
Aside from being an excellent painting, it is also a wonderful lesson in sharing our blessings. 
There are only one half of each fruit because the other half was shared with someone.

From one corner of the hall, Teacher Ligaya's eyeglasses misted with tears, but she had the biggest smile of all!
