A golden-haired boy—the little prince—suddenly appears in the Sahara, where a pilot landed his plane because of engine problems. The pilot is tries to fix the engine, for he has no food or water to survive for another week. The boy goes to the pilot and asks the pilot to draw him a picture of a sheep. Instead, the pilot draws a picture from his own childhood: a boa constrictor with an elephant in its stomach, which most people see as a hat. The boy easily recognizes that the drawing is that of a boa constrictor with an elephant in its belly.

But, the boy asks for a drawing of a sheep. After several drawings, the pilot just draws a box with air holes on it. It is only after this drawing that the boy is happy. Both the pilot and the little prince understand that a sheep is inside the box.

After exchanging stories, the man and the boy became friends. The home from which the little prince has come is an asteroid, hardly larger than a house; it holds one rose, one baobab tree, and three volcanoes. The boy hopes to learn more by visiting much larger places, such as the planet Earth, and meeting the people, animals, and plants that live in those places. However, he is always concerned about the safety of his dearly loved rose.

The little prince tells the pilot about his visits to other tiny asteroids, where he met one single resident on each: a king claiming to rule the whole universe, although he has no servants; a self-centered man who sees everyone as his admirer; a drunkard living in a daze, drinking to forget his shame of being an alcoholic; a businessman greedily counting the stars as his own treasure; and a geographer who does not know anything about his place and never leaves his office.

The smallest planet he has visited, which turns very fast (with 1,440 sunsets per day), has no homes or people, and yet the planet’s lamplighter has no moment of rest as he lights and puts out the only lamp, following orders that does not make any sense. The little prince, who sees the grown-ups as weird, respects the lamplighter for his dedicated, selfless work.

In the Sahara, the prince meets the fox, who reveals to him the secrets of life. These secrets cannot be seen by the eyes, unless the heart is involved. When the prince wants to play, the fox explains that being understanding each other time and patience. Through understanding, one rose among thousand similar roses becomes special.

The fox explains also that one is forever responsible where love is involved, that words cause misunderstandings; that rites and rituals are important but often forgotten, and that important matters are often ignored. These lessons help the little prince understand his own mistakes, and he decides to return home to protect his rose.

The boy meets the snake, who talks in riddles, and he understands the creature’s power to send him back where he came from quickly. By this time, the little prince and the pilot are now both dying from thirst. In search of water, they walk through the starry night. Near the point of collapsing, the pilot carries the little prince, without knowing if they are headed toward a water supply.

At dawn, when it is almost too late to save their lives, they find a deep, old well. The stars shimmer on the surface of the well's water. They drink, and the water tastes so sweet to them. For that moment, both the man and the boy learn the value of that water.  The sweet water feels like an earned gift. The little prince said that the beauty of the desert, a very dry place, is in the knowledge that it hides a well that has such sweet water.

The prince tells his friend that he will be leaving the next day. Neither mentions the snake. The pilot feels sad, while the prince feels fear mixed with joy about his decision to go home. When the little prince laughs to cheer his friend up, the laughter sounds like the jingle of a million little bells. He offers the pilot a farewell gift: from now on, when the pilot looks up on starry nights, he and only he will hear the little prince’s laughter. It will be comforting for both of them to know that they have each other.

The next day, on the one-year anniversary of the little prince’s arrival on Earth, the pilot comes to the same spot where he met the boy. There he sees the yellow flash of the snake as it bites the ankle of his little friend, and the boy falls quietly and gently onto the sand. Later, the little prince’s body is nowhere to be found. The pilot finally fixes his engine and leaves for home, hoping that his friend is safely back at his home, too.

 In the years afterward, on starry nights the pilot hears the little prince’s laugh and feels warm in his heart: Love is a powerful, invisible thread connecting people no matter how far apart in space and time they may be.
